## 👋 About

This project continues my journey in COD modding — now branching into the **HMW client** for MWR. Whether it’s scripting new features, tweaking mechanics, or cleaning up gameplay logic, the goal stays the same:

> Build things that *enhance the experience*, not break it.

The work here is shaped by years of modding experience, focused on smooth integration, clean code, and keeping the core gameplay enjoyable.
